Pyke: Python Knowledge Engine

Version: 0.1.alpha2

Both forward-chaining and backward-chaining rules (which may include python
code) are compiled into python. Can also automatically assemble python
programs out of python functions which are attached to backward-chaining
rules.

DOCUMENTATION:

The documentation is at:

    http://pyke.sourceforge.net

You can download a copy of this documentation to your hard drive:

    pyke_doc_html-0.1.alpha2.tar.gz

See the end of this file for how to regenerate the html files.


INSTALLATION:

Pyke requires python 2.5 (or later 2.x release).  Check with:

    $ python2.5 --version
 or $ python --version

You can download this at:

    http://www.python.org

To install pyke with easy_install, at the shell prompt just type:

    $ easy_install-2.5 pyke

If you don't have easy_install, you should install it:

    download: http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    then (as root) run: $ python2.5 ez_setup.py

Otherwise, you'll also need ply 2.3 from:

    http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/

This can be checked as follows:

    $ python2.5
    >>> from ply import lex
    >>> lex.__version__

Then you got two choices for pyke:

    pyke-0.1.alpha2-py2.5.egg


SOURCE DISTRIBUTION:

The pyke source distribution is the file:

    pyke-0.1.alpha2.tar.gz

This contains the pyke source code, documentation (both source and html), and
examples (currently only one example).


TO INSTALL FROM THE SOURCES:

    $ python2.5 setup.py install


RUNNING DOCTESTS:

To run doctests on all *.py files in the pyke directory, cd to the pyke
directory and:

    $ ./testpyke


COMPILING THE COMPILER.KRB FILE:

In pyke/compiler:

    $ python2.5
    >>> from pyke import compiler
    >>> compiler.compile('.', 'compiled_krb', ('compiler.krb',))
    $ cp compiled_krb/compiler_bc.py .
    $ rm -rf compiled_krb


EXAMPLES:

Currently there is only one example.  Read its README file for how to run it.


COMPILING THE DOCUMENTATION:

To compile the documentation into html, you'll need docutils and rest2web.
If you're running linux, your distro may have packages for these already.
Or you can:

    $ easy_install-2.5 rest2web

I used version 0.4.1 of docutils and 0.5.0 of rest2web.  I don't know if
earlier versions work OK or not.

To check your versions:

    $ python2.5
    >>> import docutils
    >>> docutils.__version__
    >>> import rest2web
    >>> rest2web.__version__

If your linux distro doesn't have packages for these, and you don't want to
use easy_install, you can get them at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/docutils
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/rest2web

To regenerate the html, cd to the doc directory and:

    $ r2w r2w.ini

This regenerates everything from doc/source into doc/html.  It takes about
2 seconds to run.

If you want to run doctest on all of the *.txt files in doc/source,
cd to doc and:

    $ ./testdocs
