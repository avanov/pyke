0.3 RELEASE NOTES 6/08/2008

I expect only minor feature enhancements at this point and am focusing now
on testing.  Often the sources under subversion are more stable than the
release.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.2 RELEASE:

    - Made use of ':' after rule names in .krb files deprecated.
    - Also eliminated use of ':' after 'python' in fc_assertions so that ':' is
      no longer used to introduce indented lines in .krb files.
    - Changed the url format in the web_framework example from "/1/movie.html"
      to "/movie/1/movie.html".

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - Added 'forall'/'require', 'notany', 'first', and 'python' premises to both
      fc and bc rules.
    - The web_framework example now caches plans.  It should be extremely fast
      now!
    - Anonymous pattern variables are now any identifier starting with an
      underscore.  This allows you to document the variable.
    - Allow the 'taking' clause to be indented on the next line after the 'use'
      clause without requiring a \ continuation.
    - Changed 'python' syntax to allow either a single python statement on the
      same line as 'python', or multiple python statements indented under
      'python'.
    - All .krb files are now automatically recompiled whenever the pyke version
      changes.
    - Top-level testall script.

Added the following web pages:

    - KRB Syntax => Compound Premise
    - Examples
    - PyCon 2008 Paper

Added the following examples:

    - knapsack example.  This is a small example that came up at the PyCon 2008
      conference.
    - findall example.  This is mostly for testing the new forall premise
      combined with the new 'python' premise.
    - forall example.  This is mostly for testing the new forall premise.
    - notany example.  This is mostly for testing the new notany premise.

BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    The 'python' assertion in fc rules didn't work.
