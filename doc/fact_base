Fact_lists store all of the facts with a certain fact_name.

Facts are a fact_name and a tuple of data (arguments).  Facts are not
represented by individual objects.

Fact_bases organize fact_lists by fact_name.

Forward chaining rules attach themselves to fact_lists so that they can be
triggered whenever a new fact is asserted (add_fc_rule_ref).

Fact_bases support a lookup generator that yields None for each match (but
binds the fact arguments as a side effect).

    def lookup(bindings, pat_context, fact_name, patterns):

They also support a 'prove' method with the same parameters, which just calls
lookup.
