Python Premise Syntax
=============================================

::

    python_premise ::= pattern '=' python_exp
                     | pattern 'in' python_exp
                     | 'check' python_exp

Each of these clauses results in a python expression being executed.  Their
meaning is as follows:

pattern_ '=' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated and the result matched
    with pattern_.  If the result does not match,
    the clause fails and backtracking_ is initiated.
    The clause always fails on backtracking_, meaning that it only produces
    a single result (contrasted with ``in``).
pattern_ 'in' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated and the first element
    from the resulting *iterable* is matched
    with pattern_.  On backtracking_, successive
    elements from the result are matched with
    pattern_.  When the result is exhausted, the clause fails.

    This has the effect of offering each element of the result, one at a
    time, to the subsequent premise clauses.  Each element is thus acted on
    individually.
'check' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated.  If the result is
    python "true" the clause succeeds, otherwise
    it fails.  The clause always fails on backtracking_.
