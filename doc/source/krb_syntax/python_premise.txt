=============================================
Python Premise Syntax
=============================================

::

    python_premise ::= pattern '=' python_exp
                     | pattern 'in' python_exp
                     | 'check' python_exp

Each of these clauses results in a python expression being executed.  Their
meaning is as follows:

pattern '=' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated and the result matched
    with *pattern*.  If the result does not match,
    the clause fails and backtracking is initiated.
    The clause always fails on backtracking.
pattern 'in' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated and the first element
    from the resulting *iterable* is matched
    with *pattern*.  On backtracking, successive
    elements from the result are matched with
    *pattern*.
'check' python_exp
    *python_exp* is evaluated.  If the result is
    (python) *true*, the clause succeeds, otherwise
    it fails.  The clause always fails on
    backtracking.
