=============================================
Pattern Syntax
=============================================

Pattern
============

::

    pattern ::= 'None' | 'True' | 'False'
              | NUMBER | IDENTIFIER | STRING | variable
              | '(' [{pattern,}] ['*' variable] ')'

IDENTIFIER acts like STRING here, meaning that it is taken as a literal
value.  All variables in patterns must be preceded by a ``$``.

Pyke does not currently support complex NUMBERS (for no good reason -- email
me if you need them).

Pattern Variable
===================

Pattern variables are simply called *variable* in the syntax::

    variable ::= '$'IDENTIFIER | '$_'

The variable must not have a space between the ``$`` and the ``IDENTIFIER``.

Anonymous Variable
====================

The ``$_`` variable is the *anonymous* variable.  It acts like a "don't
care".  Technically, this means that multiple uses of ``$_`` may stand for
multiple values.

Rest Variable
================

The ``*variable`` at the end of a tuple pattern will match the rest of the
tuple.  Thus, ``variable`` is always bound to a (possibly empty) tuple.

The syntax is taken from rest parameter syntax in python function definitions.
The difference here is that the variable needs a ``$`` on it.

You may use either a named variable or an anonymous variable here.
