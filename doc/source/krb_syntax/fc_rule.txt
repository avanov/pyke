Fc_rule Syntax
=============================================

Fc_rule
=============

Forward-chaining_ rules_ have three parts:

#. A unique name.
#. An optional ``foreach`` clause.
#. An ``assert`` clause.

::

    fc_rule ::= IDENTIFIER ':' NL INDENT
                   [fc_foreach]
                   fc_assert
                DEINDENT

The ``IDENTIFIER`` uniquely names this rule_ and is used as the corresponding
python function name in the generated <rb_name>_fc.py file.

Foreach clause
=================

::

    fc_foreach ::= 'foreach' NL INDENT
                       {fc_premise NL}
                   DEINDENT

    fc_premise ::= fact_pattern
                 | 'forall' NL
                     INDENT
                        {fc_premise NL}
                     DEINDENT
                   [ 'require' NL
                       INDENT
                          {fc_premise NL}
                       DEINDENT ]
                 | python_premise

    fact_pattern ::= IDENTIFIER '.' IDENTIFIER '(' [{pattern,}] ')'

Here are links to the definitions for pattern_ and python_premise_.

If the ``foreach`` clause is **not** used, the rule_ is always fired once.

If the ``foreach`` clause **is** used, the rule_ is fired for each
combination of true premises.

The ``forall`` clause undoes all pattern variable bindings before the next
``fc_premise`` is run.  Thus, it can only be used to test values produced by
prior ``fc_premises``, but not to generate them for subsequent ``fc_premises``.
If the ``require`` clause is missing, the ``forall`` clause always succeeds.

Assert clause
=================

::

    fc_assert ::= 'assert' NL INDENT
                      {assertion NL}
                  DEINDENT

    assertion ::= fact_pattern
                | 'python' ':' NL INDENT
                      {python_statement NL}
                  DEINDENT

The ``assert`` clause lists new facts_ to assert, and/or python
statements to execute each time the rule_ is fired.  Each of these may
include `pattern variables`_ which should also appear in the ``foreach``
clause where they are bound to a value.  These values will then be substituted
into the facts_ and python statements.
