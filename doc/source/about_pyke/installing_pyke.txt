System Requirements
====================

Pyke is 100% Python, so it should run on any platform supported by Python.
So all you'll need is `Python`_ 2.5 or 2.6.


Installation
==================

Installing the Executables
----------------------------

Pyke is registered on pypi_, so once you have `Python`_ 2.5 or 2.6 with
easy_install_ you can just type (as root)::

    # easy_install pyke

Installing the Sources
------------------------

The source code for the latest release can be found on the `Pyke project
download page`_ as ``pyke-<release>.tar.gz``.

If you want the latest developer version, read `Mercurial Repositories`_,
below.

Installing the Examples
-------------------------

There are several examples that are contained in the source directory.
There is a README file for each one that explains how to run it.

These are in the source directory in the ``examples`` subdirectory.
To download just the examples (for example, if you used easy_install to
install Pyke), download the ``pyke_examples-<release>.tar.gz`` file.

See also Examples_.

Installing the HTML Documentation
----------------------------------------

If you'd like to view this html documentation from you hard drive,
it is in the source directory (doc/html), or you can download just the
documentation itself as ``pyke_doc_html-<release>.zip`` file from the
`Pyke project download page`_.


Mercurial Repositories
======================

With mercurial_, you clone the entire repository locally on your computer.
Then you can make changes and commit those changes to your local repository.
If you think those changes might be interesting to everybody, make your local
repository (or a clone of it) publically available (either on your own server,
or on one of the `mercurial hosting sites`_) and send me an email.  I will
examine your changes and pull them into the master repository on sourceforge.

To clone the development version of the entire project (including the
examples_ and this documentation) into a directory called *foobar*::

    $ hg clone http://pyke.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/pyke/pyke foobar

Or to clone the latest release 1 branch::

    $ hg clone http://pyke.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/pyke/release_1 foobar

Use the *release_1* repository for any work that improves the quality of the
code (bug fixes, code formatting, comments, documentation) that won't break
existing programs and can go into the next point release.

Use the *pyke* repository for new features that will go into the next major
release.  I merge all the changes done in the release_1 repository into the
pyke repository.

Finally, use the *pre_2to3* repository for any work that is specific to the
Python3 version of PyKE.  Just don't run 2to3 in directly in your working
directory because it will change all of the .py files and we don't want those
changes committed!  I merge all the changes done in the pyke repository
into the pre_2to3 repository.

Repository Directory Structure
------------------------------

You'll see the following directories.

* ``doc``

  - See `Documentation`_, below.

* ``examples``

  - There are several examples.  Start with *family_relations*.  Look at the
    ``README`` file for each example to see how to run it.  See also,
    Examples_.

* ``pyke``
  
  - This is the top-level Python package directory for the Python sources.
    This needs to be in a directory on your ``PYTHONPATH``.
    The sources for the compilers are in the ``krb_compiler`` subdirectory,
    which is expected to be a subpackage of ``pyke``.


Documentation
=================

The ``doc/html`` directory in mercurial_ contains all of these documents.
You can browse these on your hard drive if you'd like.

If you want to regenerate these documents, you'll also need:

* Rest2web_, which requires:
* Docutils_

The sources for the documentation are in ``doc/source``.

To regenerate the documentation, in the ``doc/source`` directory run::

    $ bin/gen_html

This:

#. Temporarily appends hyperlink references onto all of the \*.txt files.
#. Runs ``r2w`` to regenerate the files in ``doc/html``

   - except for those in ``doc/html/stylesheets`` and ``doc/html/images``.

#. Then strips all of the hyperlink references from the \*.txt files.

I've gone ahead and placed the generated html files in mercurial so that
you can browse the documentation without having to run ``bin/gen_html``.
