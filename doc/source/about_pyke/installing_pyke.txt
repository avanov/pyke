System Requirements
====================

Pyke is 100% Python, so it should run on any platform supported by Python.
You'll need:

* `Python 2.5`_
* `PLY 2.3`_ (easy_install_ automatically installs this)


Installation
==================

Installing the Executables
----------------------------

Pyke is registered on pypi_, so once you have `Python 2.5`_ with
easy_install_ you can just type::

    $ sudo easy_install-2.5 pyke

This will automatically install `PLY 2.3`_ too.

Installing the Sources
------------------------

The source code for the latest release can be found on the `Pyke project
download page`_ as ``pyke-<release>.tar.gz``.

If you want the latest developer version, read `Subversion Directories`_,
below.

Installing the Examples
-------------------------

There are several examples that are contained in the source directory.
There is a README file for each one that explains how to run it.

These are in the source directory in the ``examples`` subdirectory.
To download just the examples (for example, if you used easy_install to
install Pyke), download the ``pyke_examples-<release>.tar.gz`` file.

See also Examples_.

Installing the HTML Documentation
----------------------------------------

If you'd like to view this html documentation from you hard drive,
it is in the source directory (doc/html), or you can download just the
documentation itself as ``pyke_doc_html-<release>.zip`` file from the
`Pyke project download page`_.


Subversion Directories
==========================

To check out the entire project (including the examples_ and this documentation)
into a directory called *foobar*::

    $ svn checkout https://pyke.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyke/trunk foobar

Anybody can check out the code, but only project members may do
``commits``.  Send me an email if you'd like to lend a hand!

You'll see the following directories.  You can also use ``svn`` to check these
out individually by simply adding the directory name onto the end of the url in
the example above and changing the directory that you want it to go into.

* ``doc``

  - See `Documentation`_, below.

* ``examples``

  - There are several examples.  Start with *family_relations*.  Look at the
    ``README`` file for each example to see how to run it.  See also,
    Examples_.

* ``pyke``
  
  - This is the top-level Python package directory for the Python sources.
    This needs to be in a directory on your ``PYTHONPATH``.
    The sources for the compilers are in the ``krb_compiler`` subdirectory,
    which is expected to be a subpackage of ``pyke``.


Documentation
=================

The ``doc/html`` directory in subversion contains all of these documents.
You can browse these on your hard drive if you'd like.

If you want to regenerate these documents, you'll also need:

* Rest2web_, which requires:
* Docutils_

The sources for the documentation are in ``doc/sources``.

To regenerate the documentation, in the ``doc/sources`` directory run::

    $ bin/gen_html

This:

#. Temporarily appends hyperlink references onto all of the \*.txt files.
#. Runs ``r2w`` to regenerate the files in ``doc/html``

   - except for those in ``doc/html/stylesheets`` and ``doc/html/images``.

#. Then strips all of the hyperlink references from the \*.txt files.

I've gone ahead and placed the generated html files in subversion so that
you can checkout the documentation without having to run ``bin/gen_html``.
