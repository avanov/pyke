===================================
Logic Tricks
===================================

This describes how to accomplish different logic operations with rules.

X OR Y
===========

For example: check for text_x($arg) OR test_y($arg).

Create a separate subgoal for the OR case, let's call it ``or_goal``.  Then use
a separate rule for each OR clause::

    or_goal_test_x:
        use or_goal($arg)
        when
            test_x($arg)

    or_goal_test_y:
        use or_goal($arg)
        when
            test_y($arg)

Then you'd use ``or_goal($arg)`` where you wanted the *OR* clause.

This can go on for any number of OR-ed clauses by just adding more rules for
``or_goal``.

IF X THEN Y
=============

For example: if test_x($arg) then test_y($arg).

What this means is that test_y($arg) must be true if test_x($arg) is true.
But if test_x($arg) is not true, then test_y($arg) doesn't matter and ``if
test_x($arg) then test_y($arg)`` is true.

Create a new subgoal, let's call it ``if_x_then_y``.  Use two rules::

    if_x_then_y_if:
        use if_x_then_y($arg)
        when
            test_x($arg)            # if this fails, the next rule will be used
            special.claim_goal()    # don't use any other rules for if_x_then_y
            test_y($arg)            # if this fails, the next rule will not be used, so if_x_then_y will fail.

    if_x_then_y_else:
        use if_x_then_y($_)         # this rule is only used if test_x($arg) fails

NOT X
==========================

For example: not test_x($arg)

You have to be careful about *not* logic because it can mean different things.
In this example, if we try ``not test_x($arg)`` and ``$arg`` is unbound what
should happen?  Should it generate all of the different values for ``$arg``
for which ``test_x($arg)`` fails?  This generally isn't very practical!

The other interpretation is that there is **no** possible binding for ``$arg``
that makes ``test_x($arg)`` true.  In this example, ``not test_x($arg)`` would
then be false, because there is some ``$arg`` value that makes ``test_x($arg)``
true.

This second interpretation can be implemented by creating a new subgoal, let's
say ``not_test_x`` and using a pair of rules::

    not_test_x_fail:
        use not_test_x($arg)
        when
            test_x($arg)            # if there is any way for test_x($arg) to be true
            special.claim_goal()    # don't use any other rules for not_test_x
            check False             # and cause this rule to fail, which causes the not_test_x goal to fail

    not_test_x_success:
        use not_test_x($_)          # this rule only runs if test_x($arg) fails, above

EXISTS X SUCH THAT Y
===============================================================

For example: there exists a ``$x`` from ``generate_x($x)``, where
``test_y($x)`` is true.

This doesn't require a new subgoal.  You can just use the following two
clauses in place of the ``exists`` test::

    generate_x($x)
    test_y($x)          # if this fails, it will backtrack and try the next value from generate_x($x)

FOR ALL X, Y
===============================================================

For example: for all $x from generate_x($x), test_y($x) is true

Use the forall clause::

    forall
        generate_x($x)
    require
        test_y($x)

Note that all pattern variable bindings done in the forall clause are undone
before the next clause is run.

This always fails on backtracking.
