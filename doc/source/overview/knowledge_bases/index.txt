Knowledge Bases
====================

Knowledge is made up of both *facts* and *rules*.  These are organized
into named repositories called *knowledge bases*.  A knowledge base is like
a directory for files on disk, except that knowledge bases may not be
nested.  Therefore, facts and goals always have a two-level name.

Here are some examples of facts you might see in a web server application::

    header.cookie('session=123456789;remember=the_alamo')
    cookie.session(123456789)
    cookie.remember(the_alamo)
    header.accept_encoding(gzip)
    header.accept_encoding(deflate)
    request.path('/my/site.html')
    request.path_segment(0, my)
    request.path_segment(1, 'site.html')
    request.path_segment(-2, my)
    request.path_segment(-1, 'site.html')

Note that three different knowledge bases (all `fact bases`_) are shown here
named ``header``, ``cookie``, and ``request``; each with multiple facts.

There are different types of knowledge bases.

- Those that contain facts are called `fact bases`_.
- Those that contain rules are called `rule bases`_.
- It is also possible to create other kinds of knowledge bases that lookup
  facts and prove goals in different ways.  The only one of these in pyke
  is the special_ knowledge base.

All knowledge bases share the same name space; so that no two of them,
regardless of their type, may have the same name.
