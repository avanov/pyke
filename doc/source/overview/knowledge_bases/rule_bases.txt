=============================================
Rule Bases
=============================================

Rule bases are collections of rules_.  A single rule base may contain both
forward-chaining_ and backward-chaining_ rules.

Rule bases are created by writing a *knowledge rule base* (or `.krb`_) file
with your favorite text editor.  Place all of your `.krb files`_ into a
directory structure.  Then load_ this directory in your python program.

The load_ will walk the directory structure recursively and
automatically compile any `.krb files`_ that have changed into python source
files.  These python modules are then automatically imported to define the
rule base.

The name of each rule base is the filename of the `.krb file`_ (with the .krb
suffix removed).  This must be a legal python identifier.

Rule Base Activation
=======================

Loading_ the rule bases only makes the rule bases available for use.  It
does not automatically activate_ any rule bases.  This must be done by your
python program.  Your program may decide to activate_ different rule bases
in different situations.  Additionally,
forward-chaining_ rules_ may be used to activate_ more specific rule bases,
based on their inferencing.


Rule Base Inheritance
========================

Rule bases use single inheritance to inherit_ the rules_ from another rule
base.  This can go on to any depth.  Both forward-chaining_ and
backward-chaining_ rules_ are inherited_.

Rule Base Categories
========================

Each root rule base implicitly defines a *rule base category*.
Each rule base category may only have one active rule base.  Once a rule
base has been activated_ in a rule base category, only children of the
currently active rule base may be activated_ from that point on.
Because these children inherit_ the rules_ of the currently active rule base;
activating_ rule bases only adds new rules_, and doesn't take any away.
