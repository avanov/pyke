=============================================
Rule Bases
=============================================

Rule bases are collections of rules.  A single rule base may contain both
forward-chaining and backward-chaining rules.

Rule bases are created by writing a *knowledge rule base* (or .krb) file
with your favorite text editor.  Place all of your .krb files into a
directory structure.  Then ``load`` this directory in your python program.

The ``load`` will walk the directory structure recursively and
automatically compile any .krb files that have changed into python source
files.  These python modules are then automatically imported to define the
rule base.

The name of each rule base is the filename of the .krb file (with the .krb
suffix removed).  This must be a legal python identifier.

Inheritance, Rule Base Categories and Rule Base Activation
============================================================

Loading the rule bases only makes the rule bases available for use.  It
does not automatically activate any rule bases.  This must be done by your
python program.  Your program may decide to activate different rule bases
in different situations.

Rule bases use single inheritance to inherit the rules from another rule
base.  This can go on to any depth.

Each root rule base implicitly defines a *rule base category*.
Each rule base category may only have one active rule base.  Once one rule
base has been activated in a rule base category, only children of the rule
base may be activated from that point on.  Because these children inherit
the rules of the currently active rule base; activating rule bases 
only adds new rules, and doesn't take any away.

Forward-chaining rules may be used to activate more specific rule bases,
based on their inferencing.
