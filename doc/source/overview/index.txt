==================
Overview
==================

Pyke is an inference engine that applies *rules* to *facts* to establish
additional facts (through forward-chaining rules), and/or to prove *goals*
and optionally assemble python functions
into customized call graphs, called *plans* (through backward-chaining rules).

Pyke may then be reset, deleting the last set of facts, so that the cycle
may be repeated using the same set of rules.

The plan capability allow the postponement of code execution until the
top-level goal has been completely proven.  This shields the code from
blind alleys and backtracking within the rules.

Once a plan has been created, it may be executed multiple times with different
arguments.  It may also be pickled,
and later run again without requiring any pyke modules.
