System Requirements
====================

Pyke is 100% python, so it should run on any platform supported by python.
You'll need:

* `Python 2.5`_
* `PLY 2.3`_ (easy_install_ automatically installs this)

Installation
==================

Installing the Executables
----------------------------

Pyke is registered on pypi_, so once you have `python 2.5`_ with
easy_install_ you can just type (you'll probably need root permission)::

    $ easy_install-2.5 pyke

This will automatically install `PLY 2.3`_ too.

Installing the Sources
------------------------

The source code for the latest release can be found on the `pyke project
download page`_ as ``pyke-<release>.tar.gz``.

If you want the latest developer version, read `Subversion Directories`_,
below.

Installing the Example
-------------------------

At this point, there is a single example that is contained in the source
directory.  There is a README file that explains how to run it.

Installing the HTML Documentation
----------------------------------------

If you'd like to view the html documentation from you hard drive,
it is in the source directory (doc/html), or you can download just the
documentation itself as ``pyke_doc_html-<release>.zip`` file from the
`pyke project download page`_.

Subversion Directories
==========================

To check out the entire project (including the example and this documentation)
into a directory called *foobar*::

    $ svn checkout https://pyke.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyke/trunk foobar

Anybody can check out the code, but only project members may do
``commits``.  Send me an email if you'd like to lend a hand!

You'll see the following directories.  You can also use ``svn`` to check these
out individually by simply adding the directory name onto the end of the url in
the example above and changing the directory that you want it to go into.

* ``doc``

  - See `Documentation`_, below.

* ``examples``

  - Currently, there is only one example: *family_relations*.  Look at the
    ``README`` file there to see how to run it.

* ``pyke``
  
  - This is the top-level python package directory for the python sources.
    This needs to be in a directory on your ``PYTHONPATH``.
    The sources for the compiler is in the ``compiler`` subdirectory,
    which is expected to be a subpackage of ``pyke``.

Documentation
=================

The ``doc/html`` directory in subversion contains all of these documents.
You can browse these on your hard drive if you'd like.

If you want to regenerate these documents, you'll also need:

* Rest2web_, which requires:
* Docutils_

The sources for the documentation are in ``doc/sources``.

To regenerate the documentation, in the ``doc`` directory run::

    $ r2w r2w.ini

This will regenerate the files in ``doc/html``, except for those in
``doc/html/stylesheets`` and ``doc/html/images``.  I've gone ahead
and placed the generated html files in subversion so that you can checkout
the documentation without having to run ``r2w``.
