=============================================
Question Bases
=============================================

Question bases contain questions for end users.  These questions can be of
various types (e.g., yes/no, multiple_choice).  The questions can be
parameterized, with the parameter values substituted into the question text
when the question is asked.  In this case, different parameter values are
treated as different questions.

The answers to all questions are automatically remembered so that if multiple
rules ask the same question, the end user only sees it once.  These answers
are erased when an `engine.reset`_ is done.

Finally, questions may have *reviews* attached to them to automatically
display different canned messages (with parameter substitution) depending on
the end user's answer.


KQB files
==========

Each question base is defined by a `.kqb file`_.  The name of each question
base is the filename of the `.kqb file`_ (with the ``.kqb`` suffix removed).
This must be a legal Python identifier.

These `.kqb files`_ are compiled and loaded automatically when you create your 
`knowledge_engine.engine`_ object.

The `.kqb file`_ contains all of the information about the question needed to
ask the question, validate the answer and output the appropriate *review*
text.

The `.kqb file`_ also specifies which parameter contains the answer.  All
parameters, except this one, must be bound to values before testing the
question.


Presenting Questions to Your End Users
======================================

Pyke provides two modules to actually present a question to your end user:

  - ask_tty
    
    This presents the question on stdout and reads stdin for the answer.

  - ask_wx

    This presents the question in a dialog box for use with wxpython_.

You may write your own module to present questions to end users.  Look at the
modules provided by Pyke for guidance.

To ask a question, Pyke looks for an ``ask_module`` attribute on:

  - the question_base object
  - then the `knowledge_engine.engine`_ object

If the `knowledge_engine.engine`_ object does not have an ``ask_module``
attribute, ask_tty is imported by default and stored there.

Here's an example of setting this attribute::

    from pyke import knowledge_engine
    from pyke import ask_wx

    engine = knowledge_engine.engine('.')
    engine.ask_module = ask_wx
