===================================
KFB Syntax
===================================

This uses the same lexical structure as `KRB files`_, except that the only
keywords are:

   - None
   - True
   - False

The name of the `fact base`_ is simply the filename with the ``.kfb`` suffix
stripped.  This must be a valid python identifier.

Syntax for KFB File
===================

::

    file ::= [NL] {fact}

    fact ::= IDENTIFIER '(' [{data,}] ')'

    data ::= 'None' | 'True' | 'False'
           | NUMBER | IDENTIFIER | STRING
           | '(' [{data,}] ')'
