<h1 class="title">Welcome to Pyke!</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Python Knowledge Engine</h2>

<p>Pyke is a knowledge-based inference engine written in 100% python that can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do both forward chaining (data driven) and
backward chaining (goal directed) inferencing.
<ul>
<li>Pyke may be embedded into any python program.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatically generate python programs by assembling individual python
functions into complete call graphs.
<ul>
<li>This is done through a unique design where the individual python functions are attached to backward-chaining rules.
</li>
<li>Unlike other approaches to code reuse (e.g. zope adapters and generic
functions), this allows the inference engine to ensure that all of the
function's requirements are completely satisfied, by examining the entire
call graph down to the leaves, before <u>any</u> of the functions are executed.
</li>
<li>This is an optional feature.  You don't need to use it, if you just
want the inferencing capability by itself.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The knowledge engine supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple <i>fact bases</i>, each with it's own list of facts.</li>
<li>Both <i>forward-chaining</i> rules and <i>backward-chaining</i> rules.</li>
<li>Multiple <i>rule bases</i>, each with it's own list of forward and/or backward-chaining rules.</li>
<li>Rule base inheritance -- <i>activating</i> the derived rule base 
includes the rules from the base rule base.</li>
<li>The inference rules are compiled into python functions, allowing 
python code snippets to be used within the rules.
This greatly enhances the expressiveness of the rules.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The automatic program generation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls the generated python programs <i>plans</i>.</li>
<li>Plans may be run multiple times without needing to rerun the inference
rules.
</li>
<li>Plans may be pickled and cached to disk to be used by other programs or
in later runs of the same program.
</li>
<li>No pyke modules are required to run the plans.
</li>
</ul>
