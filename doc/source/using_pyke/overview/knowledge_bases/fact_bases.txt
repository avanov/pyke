=============================================
Fact Bases
=============================================

Facts are organized into fact bases.  The fact bases are created
automatically as new facts are asserted.

Facts
================================

Think of a "fact" as a simple statement.  It has a name and a set of
arguments.  The arguments may be:

- strings
  - proper identifiers don't need quotes: ``Fred`` is the same as ``'Fred'``
- numbers
- None
- True/False
- tuples of any of these (including nested tuples)
  - singleton tuples don't require a comma: ``(1)`` is the same as ``(1,)``

Duplicate facts are not allowed.  An attempt to assert a fact that already
exists is silently ignored.  But note that to be a duplicate, all of the
arguments must be the same too!

Facts are immutable.  They may not be changed or retracted.  That's why
dictionaries, lists and user-defined objects are not allowed as arguments.

Case Specific Facts 
---------------------

Most facts are case specific facts.  This means that they will be deleted
when a reset is done to prepare for another run of the inference engine.
Case specific facts are asserted through either::

    pyke.assert_(kb_name, fact_name, arguments)
    pyke.add_case_specific_fact(kb_name, fact_name, arguments)

They may also be asserted by forward-chaining rules.

Universal Facts
---------------------

Universal facts are never deleted, specifically, when a reset is done.  Add
universal facts by calling::

    pyke.add_universal_fact(kb_name, fact_name, arguments)
