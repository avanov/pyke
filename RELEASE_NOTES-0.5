0.5 RELEASE NOTES Nov 9, 2008

This is the first beta release of Pyke.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.4 RELEASE:

    - The following functions now return a context manager rather than a
      generator.  Note that the parameters to these functions have _not_
      changed:
        - engine.prove_n
        - engine.prove
        - engine.lookup
        - NOTE: engine.prove_1 is not affected by this change.

        - YOU NEED TO CHANGE ALL CALLS TO THESE FUNCTIONS FROM:

            def your_function():
                for vars, plan in engine.prove_n(...):
                    <for loop body>
                <code after for loop>
          
          TO:

            from __future__ import with_statement

            def your_function():
                with engine.prove_n(...) as it:
                    for vars, plan in it:
                        <for loop body>
                <code after for loop>

    - Pyke no longer replicates the source code directory structure under the
      compiled_krb directory.  So the compiled_krb directory now has no
      subdirectories.
        - YOU SHOULD DELETE ALL compiled_krb DIRECTORIES PRIOR TO RUNNING PYKE
          0.5.
    - The two parameters, gen_root_location and gen_root_pkg, to
      knowledge_engine.engine.__init__ have been merged into one parameter.
      The default values produce the same result, so you only need to make
      source changes here if you specified values for either of the old
      parameters.
        - generated_root_dir = 'compiled_krb'

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - Changed "Page Last Modified" date to be last svn commit date in html
      documentation.
    - Added sitemap.xml to doc/html


BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug 2062109: Pyke does not run on IronPython 2.0B3 and Jython 2.5a1
        - But this fix can not be tested until new releases of IronPython and
          Jython are produced.
