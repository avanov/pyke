0.5 RELEASE NOTES Nov 7, 2008

I expect to move Pyke to beta status soon.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.4 RELEASE:

    - Two parameters to knowledge_engine.engine have changed name (but not
      meaning):
        - gen_dir      is now gen_root_location
        - gen_root_dir is now gen_root_pkg

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - Added 'special' commands to be able to run programs from rules and examine
      their results:
        - special.check_command -- runs program and checks exit status
        - special.command -- runs program and returns stdout as tuple of lines
        - special.general_command -- runs program and returns (exit_status,
                                     stdout, stderr)
    - Added .kfb files to make universal facts easier.
    - Added question bases and .kqb files so that rules can ask an end user
      questions.
    - Added a database trace_cursor to examples/web_framework/wsgi_app.py
      which is enabled by setting the TRACE_SQL env variable to anything other
      than 'False'.
    - Added performance testing and profiling harnesses to
      examples/web_framework.
    - Added default parameter values to engine.prove_1 and engine.prove_n for
      fixed_args and num_returns parameters.

Added the following web pages:

    - The web pages have been extensively revised with many new pages to help
      the person new to logic programming.

Added the following examples:

    - learn_pyke as unfinished Computer Based Training example using the new
      queston bases.
    - towers_of_hanoi as a brute force solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
      This generates multiple solutions (though only one is optimal).

BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug 2041883: installation error "Sorry: IndentationError"
    - Fixed: the web_framework example does not do database commits.
    - Fixed: small bug in examples/sqlgen/test.py cursor.execute parameters.
    - Fixed: examples/web_framework not placing the returned document into a
      singleton tuple as per WSGI spec.
