1.0.3 RELEASE NOTES Oct 19, 2009

This release has two bug fixes in it.  The big thing is that the source code
repository has been moved from Subversion to Mercurial.  This is the first
release under Mercurial.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 1.0.2 RELEASE:

    - The source code repository has been moved from subversion to mercurial
      to make it easier for people to contribute to the project.  If you have
      the source code checked out under subversion, and want to stay abreast
      of developments or contribute your changes back to the project, you will
      need to switch to Mercurial.


FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Moved the source code repository from Subversion to Mercurial!
    - Did some enhancements to examples/web_framework/web_framework.tst to
      better report server errors.
    - Added examples/web_framework/director.html as another example html
      template.
    - Upgraded to 3.3 version of PLY.
