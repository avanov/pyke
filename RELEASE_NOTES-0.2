0.2 RELEASE NOTES 3/05/2008

I expect only minor feature enhancements at this point and am focusing now
on testing.  Often the sources under subversion are more stable than the
alpha release.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.1.alpha2 RELEASE:

The top-level pyke package code has been moved into a standard module called
knowledge_engine.py.  Therefore, you need to:

    1.  Change all "import pyke" lines to "from pyke import knowledge_engine".
    2.  Change all "pyke.engine(...)" calls to "knowledge_engine.engine(...)".


FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following web pages:

    Logic Tricks

Added the following features:

    - engine.print_stats()
    - engine.trace and engine.untrace functions to trace backward-chaining
      rules.
    - added "allow_vars" parameter to "as_data" methods.
    - added test.py module to pyke package.  This lets you type in goals and
      run them interactively to help debug your rules.  Also allows you to
      test the plan functions returned from goals.

Added the following examples:

    - To family_relations:

        fc_example.krb
        bc_example.krb
        bc2_example.krb (a few rule optimizations make it 100 times faster
                         than bc_example.krb)
        
        Many enhancements to test.py, including a "general" function to show
        how to create your own patterns to prove fully general goals with
        pattern variables anywhere in the arguments.

    - Added sqlgen example.  This automatically generates sql statements,
      figuring out how to join tables together to get needed data.  This runs
      against MySQL and introspects the schema automatically.

    - Added web_framework example.  This uses the HTMLTemplate facility as its
      templating engine.  It automatically builds the program to render the
      templates, including using the sqlgen rule base to automatically build
      the sql statements to retrieve the data needed by the template.

BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

#1908852 unpickling a plan causes most of pyke to be imported.
#1908855 a comment on same line as "check" premise causes syntax errors in
         generated .py files.
#1908856 tuple patterns treat strings as tuples
#1908862 *_plans.py files not reloaded
#1908867 engine.reset wasn't reseting forward-chaining rules.
#1908870 variable binding loops were possible.
#1908875 rest_var in pattern tuple not checked properly.
#1908877 debug messages are being printed when .krb syntax errors are
         encountered.
#1908880 prove_n and prove_1 were not converting prototype plans stored in
         pattern variables into plan functions.
