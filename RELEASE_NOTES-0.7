0.7 RELEASE NOTES Jan 17, 2009

This fixes a reported bug in Pyke and also changes the way that Pyke searches
for Pyke source files during initialization so that it depends on the standard
Python Path rather than the program's Current Working Directory.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.6 RELEASE:

    - The parameters to knowledge_engine.engine.__init__ have changed.  Pyke
      no longer searchs the current working directory for your Pyke source
      files.  Your Pyke source files must now be located (either directly or
      indirectly) under a Python package directory that is on the standard
      Python Path.  You must now specify the package name containing your Pyke
      source files as a parameter to knowledge_engine.engine.__init__.

      If you pass any of the load_fc, load_bc, load_fb, or load_qb parameters
      to knowledge_engine.engine.__init__, you must now pass these as keyword
      parameters.


FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - Pyke's initialization logic no longer depends on the program's current
      working directory, making it easier to run on Windows.
    - Pyke can now load its compiled files from a Python .egg file.


BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug 2496575: "duplicate knowledge base names" bug
