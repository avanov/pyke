0.6 RELEASE NOTES Dec 30, 2008

This fixes a reported bug in Pyke and also sets up the examples to be easier
to run by not requiring that they be run from a certain directory.  This makes
them easier to run from Windows.  The sqlgen and web_framework examples were
also changed to use the Sqlite3 database rather than MySQL, again, to make the
examples easier to run.

Pyke's use of the PLY lex and yacc modules has been changed to avoid compiling
the scanner and parsers each time Pyke is run.  These changes should also help
when running Pyke on IronPython as PLY has some incompatibilities with
IronPython.

Finally, Pyke has been upgraded to run on Python 2.6 without any Deprecation
Warnings.  (And Pyke still runs fine on Python 2.5).  But to run Pyke on
Python 2.6 you will need the development version of PLY (from subversion)
until PLY comes out with it's release 2.6.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.5 RELEASE:

    - You must upgrade to PLY version 2.5.  This can be done with:
        - easy_install --upgrade ply

    - If you want to run the web_framework example, you need to upgrade the
      HTMLTemplate package to the 1.5 release.  You can use easy_install to
      install the 1.5 release, but may need to unintall the older release
      manually (I don't remember the prior release of HTMLTemplate being set
      up for easy_install). 

    - The meaning of the generated_root_dir parameter to
      knowledge_engine.engine.__init__ has been changed (as well as its name).
      The default value produces the same result, so you only need to make
      source changes here if you specified a value for this parameter.

FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - The examples no longer depend on the program's current working
      directory, making them easier to run from Windows.
    - The sqlgen and web_framework examples no longer require MySQL.  They
      have been converted to Sqlite3 and the Sqlite3 database is included in
      the examples directory.  So these examples no longer require setting up
      the database first.
    - Pyke runs on Python 2.6 without any Deprecation Warnings.
        - But you need the development version of PLY until PLY comes out with
          its release 2.6.
    - Changed Pyke's use of PLY to save the compiled scanner and parser tables
      rather than regenerating them each time Pyke is run.  These changes
      should also avoid incompatibilities between IronPython and PLY.


BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug 2339448: BC rules with nonexistent dependencies
    - Fixed bug 2062109: Pyke does not run on IronPython 2.0B3 and Jython 2.5a1
        - This fix has now been tested and runs OK on Jython.
        - The test on IronPython exposed a bug in IronPython that has been
          reported to the IronPython project (as item# 20143 on their bug
          tracking list).
