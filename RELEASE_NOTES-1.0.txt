1.0.3 RELEASE NOTES Oct 19, 2009
================================

This release has two bug fixes in it.  The big thing is that the source code
repository has been moved from Subversion to Mercurial.  This is the first
release under Mercurial.

Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyke at either:

    forum => help
 or tracker => bugs


INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 1.0.2 RELEASE:

    - The source code repository has been moved from subversion to mercurial
      to make it easier for people to contribute to the project.  If you have
      the source code checked out under subversion, and want to stay abreast
      of developments or contribute your changes back to the project, you will
      need to switch to Mercurial.


FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Moved the source code repository from Subversion to Mercurial!
    - Did some enhancements to examples/web_framework/web_framework.tst to
      better report server errors.
    - Added examples/web_framework/director.html as another example html
      template.
    - Upgraded to 3.3 version of PLY.

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug #2881934: py2exe doesn't work with Pyke
    - Applied patch #2787699: hash function returns void

      package directories in zipped egg files.

INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH 0.7 RELEASE:

    <none>


FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

Added the following features:

    - Changed the .krb parser to iterate, rather than recurse, on the list of
      rules in the file so that it doesn't hit the recursion limit on large
      .krb files.
    - Now including a copy of PLY with the Pyke sources so that I can release
      the compiled pyke/krb_compiler/*_tables.py files with Pyke and not have
      PLY try to recompile them (which generally gets a permission violation
      because normal users can't write the Python's site-packages directory).
    - Added the option to pass any module within the package to identify the
      source package to knowledge_engine.engine().


BUGS FIXED:

The following bugs have been fixed:

    - Fixed bug 2569021: string literals don't work in .kfb files.
    - Added mention of 'engine' variable within the rules documentation to fix
      bug 2588191.
