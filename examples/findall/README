This is a small example of the 'forall' clause used to gather a list of
answers in both forward-chaining and backward-chaining rules.

The forward-chaining and backward-chaining rules are in two different .krb
files showing examples of use of the 'forall' clause in both cases.

Rather than finding individual siblings and cousins, these rules find all
siblings and all cousins and assert them in a single fact (as a tuple).

    >>> import test
    >>> test.fc_test()
    ... prints out all cousins information using fc_findall.krb ...
    >>> test.bc_test()
    ... prints out all cousins information using bc_findall.krb ...
