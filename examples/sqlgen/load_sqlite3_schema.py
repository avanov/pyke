    This module loads universal facts representing a schema into a pyke engine.

    All facts are put in the "schema" fact base.

    It adds two kinds of facts:
        column(table_name, col_name, type, null, key, default, extra)
        primary_key(table_name, columns)
        many_to_1(table_many, table_1, table_many_columns, table_1_columns)
        links_to(depth, start_table, end_table, joins)

    The many_to_1 facts are determined by column names ending with "_id".
    The part before "_id" is taken as the table name being referred to with a
    primary key of ('id').

    This module only exports one function: load_schema, which you'd call once
    at startup after you've created your pyke engine.
