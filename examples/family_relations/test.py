    This example shows how people are related.  The primary data (facts) that
    are used to figure everything out are in family.py.

    There are three independent rule bases that all do the same thing.  The
    fc_example rule base only uses forward-chaining rules.  The bc_example
    rule base only uses backward-chaining rules.  And the example rule base
    uses all three (though, there isn't really a need for plans, so the plans
    are pretty contrived).

    One the pyke engine is created, all the rule bases loaded and all the
    primary data established as universal facts; there are three functions
    that can be used to run each of the three rule bases: fc_test, bc_test,
    and test.
